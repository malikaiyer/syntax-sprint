# Game Name

## Elevator Pitch

Syntax sprint transforms the struggle of learning new syntax into an exciting arcade-style experience that helps players internalize correct syntax patterns through active gameplay


## Influences (Brief)

- *Pacman*:
  - Medium: *Game*
  - Explanation: *The game navigates the player through a maze and they collect powerups while avoiding the villains*

## Core Gameplay Mechanics (Brief)

*Give a very high-level description of any core gameplay mechanics*

- *Move the player by using arrow-keys*
- *Avoid getting killed by enemies*
- *Player needs to collect all correct tokens to progress to the next level*
- *Collecting incorrect tokens may lead to spawning more enemies*
- *Player may fall into a trap that they can exit by answering a programming question*
- *There is a time limit within which the player needs to collect all the correct tokens*
- *The player starts off with 3 lives*

# Learning Aspects

## Learning Domains

*Introductory programming*

## Target Audiences

*Beginner programmers with little-to-no programming experience*

## Target Contexts

*k-12 computer labs during free time, fun game for self-motivated programmers*

## Learning Objectives

*Remember, Learning Objectives are NOT simply topics. They are statements of observable behavior that a learner can do after the learning experience. You cannot observe someone "understanding" or "knowing" something.*

- *By the end of the instruction, students should be able to identify between different common syntax in the same language*
- *By the end of the instruction, students should be able to distinguish between different programming languages*

## Prerequisite Knowledge

*What do they need to know prior to trying this game?*

- *Prior to the game, players need to be familiar with some syntax in Python*
- *Prior to the game, players need to be familiar with some syntax in Java*
- Prior to the game, players need to be familiar with some syntax in JavaScript*

## Assessment Measures

*Describe how the learning will be assessed, e.g., pre/post multiple-choice test, or SAT, or some other instrument.*

- * Define a high score that the player needs to meet to be successful in identifying different syntax in languages*
- * Being able to beat the game in a shortened time period *

# What sets this project apart?

*Give some reasons why this game is not like every other game out there. Whether the learning objective is unique, the gameplay mechanics are new, or what. You should persuade the reader that your game is novel and worthy of development. Consider arguments that would be persuasive to a Venture Capitalist, Teacher, or Researcher. These might be focused on learning needs, too.*

- *There are not many games that are focused on learning that are not quiz-like (gamified quiz)*
- *Many introductory programming courses do not test students' ability to identify different languages. This game bridges this gap*

# Player Interaction Patterns and Modes

## Player Interaction Pattern

*This game is for one-person but can be multiplayer too. The players use the arrow-keys/WASD to move the player*

## Player Modes

- *Single-player*: *player repeatendly advances through the rounds to reach the end*
- *Multi-player*: *players compete against each-other to complete the tasks fastest*

# Gameplay Objectives

- *Collect all correct tokens*:
    - Description: *Players need to collect all the right syntax tokens to advance to the next round*
    - Alignment: *This teaches the player to identify the right syntax in a given programming language fast and within a time limit*
- *Complete all rounds*:
    - Description: *Players need to complete all rounds to complete the game *
    - Alignment: *This teaches the players to distinguish between syntax in different programming languages*

# Procedures/Actions

*Players use the left-arrow key to move left, right-arrow key to move right, up-arrow key to move up, down-arrow key to move down*

# Rules

- *If the player hits a villain, they lose a heart*
- *If the player loses all hearts, they lose the game*
- *If the player collects all correct tokens, they proceed to the next round*
- *If the player completes all rounds, they will advance to the next world*
- *If the player collect a wrong token, more enemies are spawned*
- *Players need to complete minigames in-between the levels to move to the next world*

# Objects/Entities

- * Chicken icon main character *
- * Bug villain (like the emoji) *
- * Tokens that look like text boxes *
- * Heart icons that define how many hearts the player has remaining * 

## Core Gameplay Mechanics (Detailed)

- *Moving the character*: *The character moves according to the arrow keys. The character does not move continuously and can move as many blocks and spaces as the player wants*
- *Completing within the time-limit: *The player should complete each round within the time limit. The time limit is 2 minutes for each round.*
- *Correctly advancing through the rounds*: *The player must navigate through the maze to collect the correct token within the time-limit to advance to the next round. Each round will have one correct and multiple incorrect tokens.*
- *Collecting the incorrect token:  * If the player collects an incorrect token, the number of villains chasing the player increases and *
- *Advancing through the worlds*: *If the player completes all the rounds (5-6 rounds per world), they will advance to the next world which will be set in another programming language*


    
## Feedback

*Explicitly describe what visual/audio/animation indicators there are that give players feedback on their progress towards their gameplay objectives (and ideally the learning objectives).*

- *Collecting the right token will produce a positive feedback sound (like a ding)*
- *Collecting the wrong token will produce a negative feedback sound (like a dun dun dun)*
- *Text on the screen will show which world you are in (which programming language you are learning) and which round you are in *

# Story and Gameplay

## Presentation of Rules

*Initial text on the screen (title screen) will show the rules at the beginning*

## Presentation of Content

*The game does not attempt to teach the content*

## Story (Brief)

*You want to navigate the maze to get out, and the only way to do so is to collect all the right tokens and advance through the worlds*

## Storyboarding

*Go into as much detail as needs be to visually convey the Dynamics of your game. Be detailed. Create storyboards and freeze frame images that concisely capture important key elements of your game. You are strongly recommended to sketch pictures on paper and embed them here. Be sure make it clear how previously-described mechanics come through in the dynamics.*

# Assets Needed

## Aethestics

*Pixel art, arcade style music and art. Music and sound effects to guide the player*

## Graphical
